Today you will be using your knowledge of OOP, loops, and functions to build a rudimentary **space battle** game. The game will be programmed for, and played in the Chrome console. You will need to use pop-up prompts to get user input.

Today's task is to **build something according to specification**. Pretend you have received the **specification** below for a class project. Planning your program is a challenge unto itself. START SIMPLE. Break the problem down as far as you can and don't move on until the smallest piece works.

Once you've figured out the basics, it's up to you to make the game you want, but remember,
Your game does not have to be elegant. The only thing that matters is that it works.
